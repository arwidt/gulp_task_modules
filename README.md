#taskmodules

Modular gulp or grunt tasks wrapped in a npm module because I wanted more flexibility when setting up the order of when tasks are called. What tasks need to be in series and what tasks can run parallel.

##Install
`npm install taskmodules --save-dev`

##Usage
Since all modules are selfcontained you can pick those you need. You can combine gulp and grunt or your own node.js modules.

To run a task  
`taskmodules.js.browserify.create()`
